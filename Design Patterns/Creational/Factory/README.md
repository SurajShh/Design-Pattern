Factory Pattern

Use Case: Implementing a factory for creating different types of notifications (e.g., Email, SMS, Push).

Explanation: The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class. A NotificationFactory can create instances of EmailNotification, SMSNotification, or PushNotification based on the required notification type.
