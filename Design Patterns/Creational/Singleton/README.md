Singleton Pattern

Use Case: Creating a single instance of a logging service that can be accessed globally across different parts of an application.

Explanation: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created. A Logger class can use this pattern to provide a single, shared instance for logging across the application.
