Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Use Case: Implementing a series of checks in a support system for handling customer complaints (e.g., minor complaints, technical issues, and escalations).

Explanation: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows requests to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either process the request or pass it along. A SupportHandler chain could have MinorIssueHandler, TechnicalIssueHandler, and EscalationHandler for this purpose.
