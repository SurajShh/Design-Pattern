Use Case: Integrating a new payment gateway with an e-commerce system, where the gateway API differs from the current system’s API.

Explanation: The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping the new payment gateway with an adapter class that matches the existing system’s interface.
