Facade Pattern

Use Case: Simplifying the interface for starting a home theater system, which includes multiple steps such as turning on the TV, setting up the speakers, and starting the media player.

Explanation: The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of subsystems, making it easier to use complex systems. Here, a HomeTheaterFacade class can provide simple start() and stop() methods that manage all subsystem interactions.
